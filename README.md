# Apple.com Homepage Clone (Frontend Practice)

## 🧠 Overview

This project is aimed at enhancing my understanding of web development through the approach of **web cloning**.  
The goal is to replicate the **front-end structure** and visual design of the official Apple website: [https://www.apple.com/](https://www.apple.com/) — for **educational and practice purposes only**.

No backend functionality or actual services are included.  
All code is written from scratch to understand layout, components, and structure used in modern web design.

## 🔍 How to View the Project Locally

Because this project uses **JavaScript modules**, **custom elements**, or relative paths to assets, it must be served over a local server.

### Option 1: Using VS Code Live Server Extension

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (by Ritwick Dey) if you haven’t already
3. Right-click on `index.html` and choose **"Open with Live Server"**

> This will automatically start a local development server at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` or similar.
